      "fullDescription": "Filming an artist in the studio is very different from documenting an exhibition. It means entering the space where the work is born, where matter and gesture are still doubt, attempt, discovery. Dietrich followed Ernesto Neto in his studio in Rio de Janeiro, recording the creative process that both preceded and followed his exhibition at Le Bon Marché in Paris. The film doesn't just show the finished work. It reveals the artist's breath, the intimacy of manual labor, the transition between the silence of the studio and the monumentality of the installation in one of the world's most iconic spaces. This project reaffirms something essential: brands can connect with art not only by showing results, but by embracing process. That is where true resonance is built, beyond advertising.",

Each film is both intimate and theatrical, exploring how image can construct and deconstruct persona. Conceived in dialogue with Manu's own artistic universe — ironic and delicate, pop yet deeply personal — the films go beyond conventional music video aesthetics, embracing a hybrid form that belongs as much to cinema as to contemporary culture. Together, the three shorts form a mosaic of identity, revealing how narrative and style can amplify an artist's voice across different platforms while remaining authentic.",

Each scene captures the dialogue between elegance and energy, masculine and feminine, intimacy and spectacle.

The aesthetic combines humor and delicacy, capturing the season's playful spirit in a visual language that blends design, storytelling and imagination. More than a seasonal piece, *Il Neige Rive Gauche* is a dreamlike gesture, reminding us that a brand can also be a guardian of emotion and enchantment.",

Desire is not shown directly — it is suggested through gestures, textures and the rhythm of fragrance in motion. The narrative unfolds in layers: close-ups evoking touch, frames that blur the line between skin and atmosphere, a sensorial approach where perfume becomes both memory and anticipation. Instead of illustrating the product, the film creates an emotional territory where Natura's language of beauty resonates as something intimate, poetic and deeply human.",

Shot in Virtual Production, the project blends real and digital environments, with Sabrina Sato as the protagonist. The aesthetic is sharp and sophisticated: dark backgrounds, sculptural lighting, camera movements that highlight shine as performance. Transitions dive into strands of hair, which become portals to new scenes.

Inspired by the tracks of her fourth studio album, the project blends performance, narrative and cinematic aesthetics. Shot on 16mm and Alexa Mini, it is an experimental and pop portrait of Manu's persona — between dance, humor and questions of identity. Featuring João Côrtes, Paulo Miklos, Ícaro Silva, Fábio Porchat, Titi Ewbank and others, the film explores themes of self-discovery, liberation and reinvention, using references that range from choreography to adolescent memories. *Gracinha* is also about leaving a character behind and being reborn — with courage, poeticity and authenticity.",
