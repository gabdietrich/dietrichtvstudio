      "fullDescription": "Filming an artist in their studio is very different from documenting an exhibition. It is stepping into the space where the work is born, where matter and gesture are still uncertainty, experiment, discovery. At DietrichTV, we had the privilege of following Ernesto Neto in his Rio de Janeiro studio, capturing the creative process that both preceded and followed his exhibition at Le Bon MarchÃ© in Paris. Our film doesn't simply show the finished artwork. It reveals the artist's breath, the intimacy of manual work, the transition from the silence of the studio to the monumentality of an installation in one of the world's most iconic spaces. For us, this project reinforces something essential: brands can truly connect with art not only by showcasing results, but by embracing processes. That's where authentic resonance is built, beyond the borders of advertising.",

Each piece is both intimate and theatrical, exploring how image can construct and deconstruct persona. The films were conceived as a dialogue with Manu's own artistic universe: ironic yet delicate, pop yet deeply personal. Through bold visual language and precise storytelling, they move beyond conventional music video aesthetics, embracing a hybrid form that belongs as much to cinema as to contemporary culture. Together, the three shorts form a mosaic of identity, revealing how narrative and style can amplify an artist's voice across different platforms while remaining unmistakably authentic.",

The soundtrack, Jorge Ben Jor's LÃ¡ Vem Ela, sets the tone: timeless, magnetic, unmistakably Brazilian. Each frame captures a dialogue between elegance and energy, masculinity and femininity, intimacy and spectacle. The film was conceived as more than a commercial. It is a cultural encounter, weaving fashion and music into a narrative that places the brand in the heart of Brazil's creative heritage. Shot with cinematic precision, the piece amplifies Democrata's vision: sophistication with soul, classic with contemporary, craft with charisma.",

More than a film, it became a portrait of affection across generations, weaving family bonds into the fabric of one of Brazil's most iconic brands. The narrative is intimate yet universal: mothers and daughters, friendship and legacy, the simple gestures that define love. Each scene was crafted to highlight authenticity, where fashion becomes secondary to emotion, and presence becomes more powerful than performance. In this project, cinema and brand storytelling converge to honor motherhood â€” not as a concept, but as lived experience.",

The project was conceived not as a campaign in the traditional sense, but as a dreamlike gesture: snow falling on the Rive Gauche, the city turning into a stage where imagination takes over reality. Animation became the language to capture the ephemeral, blending design and storytelling in a way that feels both timeless and unexpected. At the intersection of cinema, design, and brand identity, Il Neige Rive Gauche is more than a seasonal film. It is a sensorial invitation, a reminder that a brand can also be a curator of emotions.",

Desire is not shown directly â€” it is suggested through gestures, textures, and the rhythm of fragrance in motion. The narrative unfolds in layers: close-ups that evoke touch, frames that blur the line between skin and atmosphere, a sensorial approach where perfume becomes both memory and anticipation. Rather than illustrating the product, the film creates an emotional territory, where Natura's language of beauty resonates as something intimate, poetic, and deeply human.",
